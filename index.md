[^helpers]: "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me: Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping." - *Mister Rogers*

[^kant]: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end" - *Immanuel Kant, Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

[^woody]: Inspired by: ”The note of hope is the only note that can help us or save us from falling to the bottom of the heap of evolution, because, largely, about all a human being is, anyway, is just a hoping machine." - *Woody Guthrie, Pastures of Plenty (pg. 247)*
