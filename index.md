### Ideas, Theories, a Pile

 - Be as axiomatic as possible, but keep nuance from dying out

 - [Syncretism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism)
 - in general, inquire for and favor utility and general improvement, not accuracy of representation

[^helpers]: "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping." - *Mister Rogers*

[^kant]: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end" - *Immanuel Kant, Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

[^woody]: "The note of hope is the only note that can help us or save us from falling to the bottom of the heap of evolution, because, largely, about all a human being is, anyway, is just a hoping machine." - *Woody Guthrie, Pastures of Plenty (pg. 247)*
