## Guidelines

 - Pave the cow paths
 - Truth as a cable, not a Chain (Peirce) - http://a.co/b81camA
 - Look for the Helpers (Fred Rodgers mom’s way of looking for hope in bad situations.)
 - Slide over this world a bit lightly and on the surface - [*via* Montaigne](http://amzn.to/1XDifrI)
 - Break things down
 - Make a system
 - Simple but not Simon
 - Draw to Think
 - Keep the Hope Machine Running[^woody]
 - Be Comic not tragic
 - Modular not monolithic
 - Try to avoid stepping on snails or anthills
 - Love but have intent
 - You only have control over your reactions
 - Be vulnerable: ask questions. Set aside pride.
 - In life, as in watchmaking, things added are complication
 - Don’t treat people as means to an end, but rather treat them as ends unto themselves[^kant]

### Ideas, Theories, a Pile

 - Be as axiomatic as possible, but keep nuance from dying out
 - Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others [or Postel's Law via John Postel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
 - [Syncretism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism)
 - in general, inquire for and favor utility and general improvement, not accuracy of representation
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance

[^kant]: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end" - Immanuel Kant, Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals[4]

[^woody]: "The note of hope is the only note that can help us or save us from falling to the bottom of the heap of evolution, because, largely, about all a human being is, anyway, is just a hoping machine." - Woody Guthrie, Pastures of Plenty (pg. 247)"
